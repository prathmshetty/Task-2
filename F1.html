<center><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 20px;"> Elephants are the largest living land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: <br>
    the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (L. cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). <br>
    They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea; extinct relatives include mammoths and mastodons. <br>
    Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive grey skin. <br>
    The trunk is prehensile, bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. </p>
