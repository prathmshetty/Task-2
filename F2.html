    It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. <br> 
    It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. <br>
    It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
